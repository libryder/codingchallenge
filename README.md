**Weekly Coding Challenge**

Coding Challenge is a community service that publishes one coding challenge per week. Sources will range from textbooks to interview questions to community-submitted content. Topics will range between general coding practices to engineering problems.

A problem will be posted each week with all reasonably valid solutions posted one week later. Comments aren't discouraged but a good solution will be self-explanatory and easy to read. Only solutions posted from http://gist.github.com/ or a public GitHub repo will be accepted.

Check theÂ [PivotalTracker Project Page](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/729619) if you would like to contribute. Contributing is easy:

1. For the project
2. Create a topic branch
3. Create tests and ensure you didn't break anything.
4. Submit pull request.

**Submitting Challenge Solutions**

Challenges can be submitted to the [Weekly Coding Challenge](http://weeklycodingchallenge.com) website. You can vote on solutions if you are logged in.
